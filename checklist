+	The file mode printed under the -l option consists of the entry type, owner permis-
    sions, and group permissions.  The entry type character describes the type of file,
    as follows:
           b     Block special file.
           c     Character special file.
           d     Directory.
           l     Symbolic link.
           s     Socket link.
           p     FIFO.
           -     Regular file.

+	no need for set_wid for multiple args and recursion
+	-F      Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an
             asterisk (`*') after each that is executable, an at sign (`@') after each
             symbolic link, an equals sign (`=') after each socket, a percent sign (`%')
             after each whiteout, and a vertical bar (`|') after each that is a FIFO.

-	-u (sort by time of last access) option
-	-1 option (output in 1 column) The -1, -C, -x, and -l options all override each other;
-	-h      When used with the -l option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
             Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the number of digits to
             three or less using base 2 for sizes.
-	-m      Stream output format; list files across the page, separated by commas.
-	-p      Write a slash (`/') after each filename if that file is a directory.
-	-s      Display the number of file system blocks actually used by each file, in units of 512
             bytes, where partial units are rounded up to the next integer value.  If the output
             is to a terminal, a total sum for all the file sizes is output on a line before the
             listing.  The environment variable BLOCKSIZE overrides the unit size of 512 bytes.`
-	-T      When used with the -l (lowercase letter ``ell'') option, display complete time
             information for the file, including month, day, hour, minute, second, and year.
