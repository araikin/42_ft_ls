+	The file mode printed under the -l option consists of the entry type, owner permis-
    sions, and group permissions.  The entry type character describes the type of file,
    as follows:
           b     Block special file.
           c     Character special file.
           d     Directory.
           l     Symbolic link.
           s     Socket link.
           p     FIFO.
           -     Regular file.

-	-u (sort by time of last access) option
-	-1 option (output in 1 column) The -1, -C, -x, and -l options all override each other;
-	-F      Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an
             asterisk (`*') after each that is executable, an at sign (`@') after each
             symbolic link, an equals sign (`=') after each socket, a percent sign (`%')
             after each whiteout, and a vertical bar (`|') after each that is a FIFO.
-	-h      When used with the -l option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
             Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the number of digits to
             three or less using base 2 for sizes.
